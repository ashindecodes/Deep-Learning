# Automated Detection of COVID-19 Cases Using Deep Neural Networks With X-Ray Images
In this study, a new model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest X-ray images is presented. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multiclass classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia).

The gold standard for the diagnosis and detection of COVID-19 is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It can detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA from respiratory specimens through nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs. Despite the high sensitivity and accuracy of the PCR technique, the method is highly time-consuming and resource-intensive. Therefore, considering the unprecedented spread rate of the virus across the globe and the rapid temporal progression of the disease throughout a subjectâ€™s body [4], a faster screening tool is necessary for COVID-19 outbreaks. As an alternative to the traditional PCR technique, researchers have proposed the use of radiography techniques such as Computed Tomography (CT) scans and chest X-rays (CXRs) for COVID-19 screening.
